Some NFL games that Swift attended broke viewership, ticket sales, and merchandise sales records: a Chiefs–Chicago Bears game drew the most television viewers of the weekend; a Chiefs–New York Jets game averaged 27 million viewers, making it the most-watched Sunday-night television show since Super Bowl LVII; and a Chiefs–Buffalo Bills game on January 21, 2024, became the most-watched NFL divisional playoff game ever and the most-watched program on any network since Super Bowl LVII. The Chiefs–Baltimore Ravens AFC Conference Championship Game was the most watched AFC Championship game of all time. When the Chiefs advanced to Super Bowl LVIII, some referred to the game as the "Taylor Swift Bowl". One widely cited estimate by a sports marketing company said the Kelce-Swift relationship had so stimulated ticket sales, viewership, and merchandising that the Chiefs franchise had gained $331.4 million in value in six months.In June 2024, Kelce made international headlines when he joined Swift onstage at her Eras Tour concert in Wembley Stadium.
